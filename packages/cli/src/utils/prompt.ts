${JSON.stringify(
  {
    feat: "A NEW user-facing feature or functionality that adds capabilities",
    fix: "A bug fix that resolves an existing issue",
    docs: "Documentation only changes (README, comments, etc)",
    style:
      "Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)",
    refactor:
      "Code restructuring, improvements, or internal changes that enhance existing functionality",

    chore:
      "Maintenance tasks, config updates, dependency updates, or internal tooling changes",
    revert: "Reverts a previous commit",
  },
  null,
  2
)}

IMPORTANT: 
- Use 'feat' ONLY for NEW user-facing features
- Use 'refactor' for code improvements, restructuring, or internal changes
- Use 'chore' for config updates, maintenance, or internal tooling
- Use the exact type name from the list above.`,

CRITICAL RULES:
- Return ONLY the commit message line, nothing else
- Use format: type: subject (NO scope, just type and subject)
- Maximum ${maxLength} characters (be concise but complete)
- Imperative mood, present tense
- Be specific and descriptive
- NO explanations, questions, or meta-commentary
- ALWAYS complete the message - never truncate mid-sentence

ACCURACY RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Describe ONLY what is explicitly shown in the provided diff/changes
- DO NOT infer, assume, or imagine features not directly visible in the code
- DO NOT base commit messages solely on file names - read the actual changes
- If you see CSS/styling changes, say "style" or "update styling", NOT "add feature"
- If you see className/UI changes without new functionality, it's "style" NOT "feat"
- When uncertain about the scope, use more general terms ("update", "improve") rather than specific features
- Focus on what the code actually does, not what you think it might enable

COMMIT TYPES (use the right one):
- feat: NEW user-facing feature or functionality (new components, new APIs, new capabilities)
- fix: bug fix that resolves an issue or error
- docs: documentation changes only
- style: formatting, CSS/UI changes, white-space (no logic change)
- refactor: code restructuring, improvements without changing behavior
- perf: performance improvements
- test: adding/updating tests
- build: build system changes
- ci: CI/CD changes
- chore: maintenance tasks, dependencies, config updates

QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Start with the most important change
- Use specific, descriptive language based on actual code changes
- Include the main component/area affected when clear
- Be clear about what was done, not just what files changed
- Use proper grammar and punctuation
- Be conservative - it's better to be slightly vague than wrong

CORRECT EXAMPLES (NO scope, just type and subject):
- feat: add user login with OAuth integration
- fix: resolve memory leak in image processing service
- refactor: improve message generation with better prompts
- style: update sidebar styling and add mode toggle
- docs: update installation and configuration guide
- test: add unit tests for JWT token validation
- chore: update axios to v1.6.0 for security patches

WRONG EXAMPLES (these are hallucinations - don't do this):
- "feat: add collapsible sidebar" when diff only shows CSS changes
- "feat: implement dark mode" when diff only adds a toggle button
- "feat: add new dashboard" when diff only adjusts layouts
- feat(auth): add user login  [wrong: has scope]
- refactor(commit): improve prompts  [wrong: has scope]

${contextInfo}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Title: 
   - Use conventional commit format: type: description
   - Maximum 72 characters
   - Reflect the overall PR, not a single commit message
   - Do not copy any commit message verbatim
   - If changes span multiple types/areas, prefer a broad type like "chore" or "refactor"
   - Otherwise pick the dominant type based on the overall changes
   - Be specific about the major themes (e.g., tooling + UI), not generic

2. Body: 
   - Use markdown formatting
   - ${isSimple ? "Keep it brief and focused" : "Be thorough and detailed"}
   - Structure with clear sections
   - Describe WHAT changed functionally, not raw statistics
   - Do NOT include file counts, additions/deletions, or any numeric stats in the body
   - Cover all major areas represented in the commit list (do not ignore later commits)
   ${context.issue ? `- Include "Closes #${context.issue}" at the end` : ""}

BODY STRUCTURE:
## Summary
<1-3 sentences explaining the overall change set and why it matters>

## Changes
- Group by theme when multiple areas exist (e.g., Tooling, UI, Docs)
- Use bullets with concrete details (what changed, where, and why)
- Mention key files/components when clear from the diff summary
${context.issue ? "\n## Related Issues\nCloses #" + context.issue : ""}

EXAMPLES OF GOOD PR DESCRIPTIONS:

Example 1 (Tooling / Maintenance):
TITLE: chore: replace ESLint with Biome and refresh dependencies
BODY:
## Summary
Modernizes the development workflow by standardizing on Biome for linting/formatting and updating project dependencies for consistency and faster CI.

## Changes
- Removed ESLint config and related packages
- Added Biome configuration and updated scripts/tooling to use Biome
- Updated dependency versions and lockfile to match the new setup

Example 2 (UI / Styling):
TITLE: style: refresh docs viewer and sidebar layout
BODY:
## Summary
Improves readability and navigation by refining the docs viewer layout, sidebar styling, and related UI components.

## Changes
- Updated sidebar spacing, typography, and active states for clearer navigation
- Refined docs viewer styles to improve content hierarchy and code block presentation
- Polished related UI components to keep visuals consistent across the app

BAD EXAMPLE (never do this):
TITLE: chore: update files
BODY:
11 files changed, +2242 additions, -4373 deletions.

^ This is WRONG. Never echo raw stats. Always describe the actual functional changes.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE EXACTLY LIKE THIS:
TITLE: <your title here>
BODY:
<your markdown body here>

Do not include any other text or explanations. Write a real, specific description for this PR based on the actual changes shown above.`;
